# Data Analyst
Experienced in consulting with a robust foundation in data engineering and analytics, I've spent over three years at Deloitte developing strategic solutions across healthcare and retail sectors. Currently pursuing a degree in Business Analytics and Data Science at Oklahoma State University, I am gearing up to transition into roles in data engineering and data analysis.

As a Data Science Intern at Infinedi, Iâ€™ve refined my skills in implementing scalable ETL pipelines using Python and PySpark and designed a Data Lakehouse architecture that significantly enhances data accessibility and analytics capabilities, all while ensuring compliance with HIPAA standards. I've also developed an AI-driven chatbot that supports real-time database access through natural language SQL queries.

During my tenure at Deloitte, I leveraged my data analysis skills to enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiencies, utilizing data to drive informed decision-making and system integrations.

Technical Skills:

Languages: Python, SQL, Scala (Beginner)
Databases/Cloud Computing: Azure (Synapse Analytics, Databricks, ADLS, ADF), GCP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HBase
Data Engineering: Hadoop, Hive, Spark, PySpark, SparkSQL, Kafka, Data Modeling, Data Warehousing
Tools/Libraries: Tableau, Power BI, JMP Pro, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium, Sklearn, Git

I am eager to apply my analytical capabilities and technical expertise to roles in data engineering and data analytics, helping organizations leverage data for strategic advantages.
